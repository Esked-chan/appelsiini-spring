In this document I mention the assets I used while creating web-pages for the semester project.

- The background images were created with the help of ChatGPT. Since the last semester project had a winter theme, this time I decided to stick to rainy spring.

- The sound effects for button hover, button click, and the sound of rain were taken from pixabay (URL: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/).

- The Home page design idea was based on this YouTube tutorial: https://youtu.be/rIA2wlXkvQo?si=n1QCbTxmi18w6sSM

- The rain effect was added with JavaScript. I used this YouTube tutorial:https://youtu.be/ni2Sm_j-PjU?si=g7yP296SmhYqH6Uo

- The pages "About" and "Our Team" were recycled from the last semester's project (with appropriate changes, of course).
